# Implementation Plan - Project Cleanup and Sync

This plan outlines the steps to resolve all ESLint errors, synchronize the repository with Git, and provide a master PowerShell script for future maintenance.

## Phase 1: Audit and Identification
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and capture all errors.
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles.
- [ ] Identify files requiring manual fixes that `--fix` cannot handle.

## Phase 2: Code Correction
- [ ] Fix ESLint errors in `src/project-planner/App.tsx` (e.g., `rel="noopener"` for links).
- [ ] Resolve any unused variable warnings.
- [ ] Address React purity/hook issues (e.g., `useCallback` wraps).
- [ ] Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.

## Phase 3: Synchronization
- [ ] Stage all changes.
- [ ] Commit with a descriptive message.
- [ ] Pull latest changes from remote.
- [ ] Push local changes to remote.

## Phase 4: Master Script Creation
- [ ] Create a comprehensive PowerShell script (`sync-and-fix.ps1`) that automates the entire process:
    - Git status and sync.
    - dependency installation.
    - Linting and fixing.
    - Build validation.
